        <h3>Uploading Featured images for the carousel</h3>

<h2>Step 1:</h2>

<p>To upload images to the server for use in the slideshow, you have to crop them. Cropping them should be done in Photoshop, and with a height/width of 322/550, respectively. However, Most images on the site can't do this. If your image is more vertical than horizontal, crop it vertically with a height of 550. If the end height is about 100px near 322px, then you should be fine. If not, you should crop it to as close to that shape as possible. Then, you must resize the image to the same specifications as before. Once you've cropped and resized to the proper approximate size, move on to step 2.</p>

<h2>Step 2:</h2>

<p>Uploading images to the server can be difficult, and WordPress doesn't recognize the file format that I have set up for usage. The format is: name-of-image-xxxxxxx.jpg-full where name-of-image is the name of the picture you've chosen, and xxxxxxx is the string of numbers, letters, and symbols at the end of the name of the image. .jpg is the file extension, just like .png, .txt, and .doc. After the file extension, you put -full, which is an addition to the .jpg that is used. You can upload pictures to the website by (on a mac) clicking on the desktop, then pressing Command-k. It will say "Connect to Server". Inside the text box, type in "<a>ftp://thenewtonite.com/</a>", and press enter. Your username is newtonite, and your password is one of our standard passwords. Windows users can visit net2ftp.com or ftplive.com. I have personally tested these two sites and they should allow you to upload images to the site and download images for editing from the site. You require the normal username and password.</p>

<h2>Step 3:</h2>

<p>Once you've uploaded the image and set the name, you should be all set. Reload the site and test it out! If you have any problems, either find me or send me an email at alexwpotter@gmail.com. Good luck!</p>
